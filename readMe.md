This is an interesting challenge from The Complete Java Development Bootcamp on Udemy,It basically builds out the very basic functions of a bank:to open an account,withdraw and deposit

What I mainly did is the performance optimization.After optimization, all basic operations on bank cost O(logN)

Any suggestion is welcome.
Hello world and Happy coding!
