This is an interesting challenge from The Complete Java Development Bootcamp on Udemy,It basically builds out the very basic functions of a bank:to open an account,withdraw and deposit

What I mainly did is the performance optimization.After optimization, all basic operations on bank cost O(logN),except that deductTaxes() function which cuts all taxes from all accounts.

Any suggestion is welcome.
Hello world and Happy coding!
